## About Me
Hi, I’m Filip. I am a dedicated and skilled data science professional with an MSc in Data Science from the University of Sheffield,
where I developed expertise in R, Python, SQL, data visualization, and ML and I am on track to graduate with a distinction.
My academic foundation is complemented by a BA in Business and Marketing from Coventry University, achieved with First Class Honours,
where I developed my soft-skills and gained strong insight into business principles. With a diverse professional background,
including roles such as Credit Controller, Data Entry Clerk, and CSR, I bring attention to detail, problem solving skills, communication skills,
and ability to work under pressure to any role. I am now looking for a Data Science role that would allow me to apply and further develop my skillset.
### Tools
- Programming: SQL, Python, R
- Other software and platforms: Tableau, SPSS, KNIME, Databricks, Excel, Microsoft Dynamics (CRM), Visual Studio Code
